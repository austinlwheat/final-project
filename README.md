# MUSA 509 2021 — Final Project

The final project will be the culmination of all of the skills learned and practiced in this class. Students will build a data pipeline and a dashboard to help make some domain-specific operational decisions. The pipeline will extract data from various 3rd-party sources, load that data into a data warehouse, transform the data into an appropriate domain model, and render reports populated with maps, charts, and prose.

Expectations:
* Pipelines will be built in Airflow (unless prior approval for a different platform is received).
* Multiple data sources will be used, at least one of which gets updated "frequently" (no less than monthly).
* Reports contain at least one chart, one map, and one dynamically generated paragraph.
* Queries to build reports are simple (no complex joins, limited sub-queries and CTEs); data should be pre-transformed for the domain.
* Reports will be hosted in the cloud at a URL that can be publicly accessed.

This project may be done individually or in a team of up to 3 students.

## Proposal

A project proposal is due Wednesday, Nov 17th. Please create a GitHub repository on your account with a name of your choosing. Place your proposal in your project GitHub repo in a file called `proposal.md`. Write the proposal in markdown (how all class READMEs are written). If you need a markdown reference, check out [GitHub's](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). There are [many more online](https://www.google.com/search?q=markdown+reference).

The proposal consists of:

1. Abstract — a paragraph description of the problem/situation/domain/etc. The Abstract should clearly state the types of decisions that your dashboard is going to help facilitate.
2. List of data sources you intend to use for this project. For each data source, please list:
   * Where you can get access to the dataset (e.g., a URL, government agency, third-party API, BigQuery public dataset, etc.)
   * Size of dataset (if applicable)
   * Whether you currently have access to this data

3. Wireframes of the webpage(s) for your project. See [this page](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/how-to-create-your-first-wireframe/) for guidance on creating wireframes. Hand-drawn or digital are both acceptable, but please scan or take pictures of the hand-drawn ones for inclusion in the repo. Link the images in the proposal markdown. Interactive wireframes are acceptable too. Many free and paid tools exist for creating wireframes (Adobe Wireframe XD, [MockFlow](https://mockflow.com/), [Figma](https://www.figma.com/wireframe-tool/), etc.)
